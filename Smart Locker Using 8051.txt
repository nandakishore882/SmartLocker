This is Smart Locker Using 8051 microcontroller, When the locker gets activated LCD screen asks to press the button 4, after doing that we receive an OTP which is randomly generated and is secure. We need to enter that OTP to the locker with the help of push buttons. We provide the user with a maximum of 3 attempts, with each wrong entry a red LED is glows, and when the right passcode is entered green LED
glows.
A c code is written where 4 numbers keep on rotating and when the pushbutton ‘4’ is pressed, an interrupt occurs and the number where it was then gets stored as OTP this is how OTP is generated. Now, this code needs to be sent to the user mobile as message, this can be done with
help od GSM module, and it can be easily interfaced with Arduino UNO. So, we are sending the OTP from the 8051 to Arduino through Serial communication. In the proteus simulation we glown an LED connected to Arduino. This does mean that when the data is serially received to Arduino from 8051 the LED is glown. And from here it is easy to interface GSM with Arduino and we can send the OTP to the user mobile.
Next step is to enter the code or OTP into the device for each wrong attempt a red led glows and when the right passcode is entered green LED is glows.
